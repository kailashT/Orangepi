commands: 

1 : sudo apt install moc moc-ffmpeg-plugin

2 : cd $home

3 : ls -a .moc

4 : mkdir .moc

5 : gunzip -c /usr/share/doc/moc/examples/config.example.gz > .moc/config

6 : vim .moc/config

	change lines to 
	SoundDriver = ALSA
	ALSADevice = default
	ALSAMixer1 = "Line Out"
	ALSAMixer2 = DAC
	
	The second was a bit more problematic. In the end, all that needed to be done was to play a longish wav file with aplay in one terminal and to start up alsamixer in another terminal to find the names given to the "mixers" that controlled the volume.

Using the Console

michel@opiz:~$ mocp
